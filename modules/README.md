# Example Modules

This directory contains example modules to demonstrate the plugin structure.

Each module directory must contain a `MODULE.md` file that describes the module and its capabilities. Files can include a `oneliner:` marker in their first 10 lines to provide inline descriptions in the file listing.

## Structure

```
modules/
└── example/
    ├── MODULE.md           # Required: module description
    ├── hello.sh           # Scripts with oneliner markers
    └── process.py
```
