# Example Skills

This directory contains example skills to demonstrate the plugin structure.

Each skill directory must contain a `SKILL.md` file that describes the skill and its capabilities. Files can include a `skill-part:` marker in their first 10 lines to provide inline descriptions in the file listing.

## Structure

```

    ├── SKILL.md           # Required: skill description
    ├── hello.sh           # Scripts with skill-part markers
    └── process.py
```
